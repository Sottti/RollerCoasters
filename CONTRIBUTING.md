# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Roller Coasters.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a focused branch from `dev`.
3. Keep changes small enough to review.
4. Run the relevant checks before opening a pull request.
5. Open a pull request using the template and describe the behavior change.

## Local Checks

Run the narrowest check that covers your change. Use JDK 21 or newer. For broad changes, run:

```bash
./gradlew checkModuleDependencyBoundaries detekt lintDebug test \
  -PexcludeSnapshotTests=true \
  verifyPaparazziDebug koverXmlReport koverVerify assembleDebug
```

Run Paparazzi with `--no-parallel` if a local Gradle configuration enables parallel execution:

```bash
./gradlew --no-parallel verifyPaparazziDebug
```

## Pull Requests

Pull requests should include:

- What changed.
- Why the change is needed.
- How it was verified.
- Screenshots or recordings for visible UI changes.

Please keep unrelated formatting, generated files, and IDE metadata out of the
pull request unless they are required for the change.
