# Roller Coasters (Android Playground)

Roller Coasters is a personal playground where I experiment with modern Android development practices, libraries, and tools. It is a space to try new APIs, patterns, and approaches—especially around Jetpack Compose—without the constraints of production code.

The project is under active development and the codebase is not yet stable or nearly finished.

## Current Features
- **Explore** feed showcasing coasters filtered by specifics like specs or materials.
- **Favourites** list of favourite roller coasters
- **About** screen with information about me
- **Roller coaster details** with detailed information and images
- **Settings** to pick dynamic color, theme, color contrast, language and measurement system.
- **Dynamic theming** (Material 3, dynamic colors and color contrast)
- Support for multiple languages and measurement systems

## Planned Features
- **Search** roller coasters directly by name
- **Parks** as first class entities
- **Better discovery** including filtering by manufacturer, park...

## Current Tech
- **Jetpack Compose** for all UI components and previews
- **Paging** for efficient data loading
- **Hilt** for dependency injection
- **Room** and **DataStore** for local persistence
- **Ktor** client for networking
- **WorkManager** for background tasks
- **Coroutines** and **Flow** for asynchronous work
- **Gradle Version Catalog** for centralized dependencies
- **Paparazzi** screenshot tests

## Planned Tech Updates
- **Navigation** using Jetpack Compose Navigation 3
- **Animations** for enhanced user experience
- **Large screens support** with multi-window and foldable devices
