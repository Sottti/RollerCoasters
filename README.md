# Roller Coasters (Android Playground)

Roller Coasters is a personal project where I experiment with modern Android development practices, libraries, and tools. It serves as a playground to explore new features and APIs in Android development, particularly with Jetpack Compose.

## Features

- **Jetpack Compose** for all UI components and previews
- **Paging** for efficient data loading
- **Hilt** for dependency injection
- **Room** and **DataStore** for local persistence
- **Ktor** client for networking
- **WorkManager** for background tasks
- **Dynamic theming** (Material 3, dynamic colors and color contrast)
- **Paparazzi** screenshot tests
- Support for multiple languages and measurement systems
