# Roller Coasters (Android Playground)

Roller Coasters is a personal playground where I experiment with modern Android development
practices, libraries, and tools. It is a space to try new APIs, patterns, and approaches—especially
around Jetpack Compose—without the constraints of production code.

The project is under active development and the codebase is not yet stable or nearly finished.
