# Roller Coasters (Android Playground)

Roller Coasters is a personal playground where I experiment with modern Android development practices, libraries, and tools. It is a space to try new APIs, patterns, and approaches—especially around Jetpack Compose—without the constraints of production code.

The project is under active development and the codebase is not yet stable.

## Current Features

- **Home** feed showcasing featured and trending coasters
- **Explore** screen with filters for height, speed and park
- **Detailed** pages with pictures and statistics
- **Favourites** collection stored locally
- **Settings** to pick theme and measurement system
- **About** screen with project info
## Planned Features
- **Search** roller coasters directly by name
- **Parks** as first class entities
- **Offline mode** with caching for frequent data
- **Better discovery** including filtering by manufacturer
- **Shareable links** to individual roller coasters

## Current Tech
- **Jetpack Compose** for all UI components and previews
- **Paging** for efficient data loading
- **Hilt** for dependency injection
- **Room** and **DataStore** for local persistence
- **Ktor** client for networking
- **WorkManager** for background tasks
- **Coroutines** and **Flow** for asynchronous work
- **Gradle Version Catalog** for centralized dependencies
- **Dynamic theming** (Material 3, dynamic colors and color contrast)
- **Paparazzi** screenshot tests
- Support for multiple languages and measurement systems

## Planned Tech Updates
- **Navigation** using Jetpack Compose Navigation 3
- **Animations** for enhanced user experience
- **Large screens support** with multi-window and foldable devices
- **Continuous Integration** with GitHub Actions
- **Further modularization** for faster builds
