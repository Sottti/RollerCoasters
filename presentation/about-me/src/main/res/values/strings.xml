    <string name="topic_android_jetpack_compose_description">I\'ve been using Jetpack Compose since its very first alpha releases in 2020 and have enjoyed every minute. \n\nAt Cuvva, I made one of the initial production commits incorporating Jetpack Compose in late 2020. Our team subsequently participated in a <a href="https://developer.android.com/stories/apps/cuvva-compose">research program</a> with Google¹ that was showcased at <b>Google I/O 2021</b>. \n\nI\'ve had the pleasure of creating Android <b>Design Systems</b> using both the traditional Android View system and Jetpack Compose. For me, Jetpack Compose represents a significant step forward for the Android UI toolkit.</string>

    <string name="topic_android_material_design_description">I\'ve been a fan of Material Design since its introduction in 2014, as it was my gateway to understanding Design Systems and UI design principles.\n\nI\'ve worked extensively with Material Design 2 and Material Design 3 (which incorporates Material You). Currently, I\'m diving into the expressive capabilities of Material Design 3, and I plan to migrate this app to these advancements as soon as possible.</string>

    <string name="topic_android_design_systems_description">I am deeply passionate about design and design systems, topics I discuss with great enthusiasm. I\'ve had the privilege of contributing to the creation of two design systems from the ground up.\n\nFurthermore, I\'ve gained valuable experience developing these systems for both the traditional Android View system and Jetpack Compose, a process I found immensely rewarding. In my view, a robust design system is a cornerstone not only for a successful product but for the entire company.</string>

    <string name="topic_android_architecture_description">I recall when the industry consensus shifted, recognizing that consolidating all functionality into a single Activity wasn\'t a sustainable architecture. Today, discussions often emphasize that an overabundance of layers and abstractions can similarly introduce challenges. Android architecture has undeniably evolved significantly.\n\nReflecting on the progression through various software design patterns (such as MVP, MVVM, MVC, and MVI), architectural solutions like Clean Architecture, and the SOLID principles, I find it engaging to explore what remains truly relevant and which new paradigms are shaping Android Engineering in its dynamic landscape. App modularization stands out as a critical component in this context, though its implementation demands a unique strategy for each project and team, carefully balancing the inherent trade-offs.\n\nMy practical experience with modularization is extensive, spanning applications from a single module to those exceeding a thousand. I\'ve successfully navigated migrations from monolithic designs to highly modular architectures, and the versatility of modular approaches continues to be a source of fascination. While the full spectrum of modularization benefits isn\'t always immediately apparent, I am a strong advocate for its adoption, given the significant long-term advantages it offers in project maintainability, scalability, and team collaboration.</string>
